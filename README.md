Welcome to CPP Eats
This is a free web service created for CPP students. Our intent is to help the large number of commuter students that are not very familiar with the surrounding area, by providing them with information on places to eat near campus.
By simply searching a category of food the user will receive a list of businesses that fit that category along with relevant information like a phone number and address.
